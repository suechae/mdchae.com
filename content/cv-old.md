Experience
Research
2011 May~Present, Pediatric Tumor Biology and Ultrastructural Pathology SectionLaboratory of Pathology, NCI, NIH
Supervisor : Maria Tsokos, M.D. (mtsokos@mail.nih.gov)
Participated molecular cancer research
Performed western blot and immunohistochemistry for elucidating pathogenesis of Ewing's Sarcoma 
2010 Summer, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, South Korea
Supervisor : Professor Soon-Chul Ahn, Ph.D. (scahn@pusan.ac.kr)
Participated basic immunology research with an animal model for experimental asthma
Performed RNA isolation (QIAGEN kit), quantitative PCR or conventional PCR
2010 Spring, Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, South Korea
Supervisor : Professor Hak-sun Yu, Ph.D. (hsyu@pusan.ac.kr)
Participated basic molecular biology research about Clonorchis sinensis 
Performed immunohistochemisry of human liver sample (cholangiocarcinoma)
siRNA knockdown in HUCCT-1 (Cholangiocarcinoma cell line)
2009 Winter, Department of Family Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, South Korea
Supervisor : Professor Dong-Uk Jung, M.D. (dwjeong75@hanmail.net)
Participated clinical research about metabolic syndrome
Performed statistical analysis of 1307 patients
Calculated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, QUICKI)
Conclusion: Higher fasting plasma glucose levels within the normoglycemic range may constitute a risk of insulin resistance in normoglycemic adults, and this is more associated with metabolic syndrome than cardiovascular risk factor.
